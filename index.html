        <p style="color: brown;">Goals are the desired outcomes that provide direction, motivation, and purpose, acting as a roadmap for life by turning vague dreams into actionable plans through focused effort, persistence, and breaking down large ambitions into smaller, manageable steps, ultimately leading to personal growth and a sense of accomplishment</p>
        <p style="color: darkblue;">Setting goals helps you stay on track, improves self-confidence, and encourages continuous learning, whether for academic success, career development, or overall well-being, making life's journey more intentional and rewarding.</p>
